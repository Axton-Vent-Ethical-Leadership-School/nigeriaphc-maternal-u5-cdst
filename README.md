## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
### Data Collection
The MaternalU5Triage AI system will integrate multi-source datasets to enable predictive modeling of maternal and under-five health risks. The system will combine public health indicators, anonymized clinical records, and genomic datasets to build a comprehensive AI training dataset.

#### Public Health Datasets
Population-level maternal and child health indicators will be obtained from international health data repositories, including:
- World Health Organization Global Health Observatory
- UNICEF Data Warehouse
- World Bank Health Indicators Database
- Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS)
- Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)

**Key indicators include:**
- Maternal mortality ratio
- Under-five mortality rate
- Neonatal mortality rate
- Antenatal care coverage
- Skilled birth attendance
- Postnatal care coverage
- Childhood vaccination coverage
- Maternal nutrition indicators
- Child growth and nutrition indicators

These datasets will provide population-level predictors and contextual determinants of maternal and child health outcomes.

#### Clinical Datasets
Anonymized clinical datasets will be used to capture patient-level variables relevant to maternal and neonatal outcomes.
**Sources include:**
- Public clinical trial repositories
- Open electronic health record datasets
- Maternal and neonatal health registries
- Hospital datasets shared under ethical approval
**Key clinical variables include:**
- Maternal age
- Parity and obstetric history
- Blood pressure measurements
- Hemoglobin levels
- Pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia, gestational diabetes)
- Delivery type and birth outcomes
- Neonatal birth weight
- Apgar scores
- Neonatal complications

All patient data will be fully anonymized and de-identified to comply with ethical and privacy standards.

#### Genomic and Biological Datasets
To support AI-driven biomedical discovery, the system will incorporate open biological and genomic datasets relevant to maternal and neonatal health.
**Sources include:**
- National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genomic repositories
- European Genome-phenome Archive
- UK Biobank (open-access datasets where available)

**Relevant biological data may include:**
- Gene variants associated with pregnancy complications
- Genetic markers related to neonatal disorders
- Proteomic and biomarker datasets
- Phenotypic measures related to maternal and child health
These datasets support the development of AI models capable of identifying biological patterns linked to maternal and neonatal risk factors.
### Data Preprocessing
Before training AI models, all datasets will undergo rigorous preprocessing and harmonization to ensure quality and interoperability.
#### Data Cleaning
The following preprocessing procedures will be applied:
- Removal of duplicate records
- Handling missing values using statistical imputation methods
- Detection and correction of inconsistent or erroneous entries
- Standardization of units and measurement formats
#### Data Standardization
To allow integration across multiple datasets:
- Variables will be normalized to consistent units
- Health indicators will be mapped to standardized clinical terminology
- Categorical variables will be encoded using machine-readable formats
#### Data Anonymization
All patient-level datasets will undergo strict privacy protection procedures:
- Removal of personally identifiable information
- De-identification of patient identifiers
- Compliance with global ethical standards for health data research
#### Data Integration
After preprocessing, datasets will be merged into a unified AI training dataset containing:
- Demographic variables
- Clinical health indicators
- Public health contextual data
- Biological and genomic features
- ## 2. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step in the development of the MaternalU5Triage AI system, as it transforms raw datasets into structured variables that can be used effectively by machine learning models to predict maternal and under-five health risks. The system will derive meaningful predictors from integrated public health, clinical, and biological datasets to improve the accuracy of AI-based triage and early warning systems.
### Identification of Key Risk Factors
Key predictive variables will be extracted from the collected datasets based on established maternal and child health research. These variables represent known determinants of maternal complications, neonatal outcomes, and under-five mortality.
**The main categories of risk factors include:**
#### Maternal Demographic Factors
- Maternal age
- Parity (number of previous births)
- Maternal education level
- Household socioeconomic status
- Geographic location (urban or rural)
#### Pre-Existing Medical Conditions
- Hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus
- Anemia
- Obesity or malnutrition
- Previous obstetric complications
#### Pregnancy and Birth Complications
- Preeclampsia or eclampsia
- Gestational diabetes
- Preterm labor
- Prolonged labor
- Cesarean delivery
- Postpartum hemorrhage
#### Neonatal and Child Health Indicators
- Birth weight
- Gestational age at delivery
- Apgar score
- Neonatal infections
- Immunization status
#### Environmental and Social Determinants
- Air pollution exposure
- Household sanitation conditions
- Access to clean drinking water
- Climate and seasonal factors
- Distance to health facilities
These variables form the core predictive features used by the MaternalU5Triage AI models.
### Generation of Derived Features
In addition to raw variables, the system will compute derived features that capture complex interactions between health indicators and environmental conditions. Derived features improve model performance by summarizing multiple risk factors into meaningful indices.
**Examples include:**
#### Maternal Comorbidity Score
A composite score representing the combined burden of maternal health conditions, calculated from variables such as:
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Anemia
- Previous pregnancy complications
#### Maternal Nutrition Index
An index calculated using indicators such as:
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Hemoglobin levels
- Dietary diversity indicators
- Micronutrient deficiencies
#### Neonatal Risk Index
A derived score combining early life indicators including:
- Low birth weight
- Premature birth
- Neonatal infection markers
- Apgar score
#### Environmental Exposure Metrics
Environmental risk indicators derived from geospatial and environmental datasets, including:
- Air pollution levels (PM2.5 exposure)
- Heat stress or extreme temperature exposure
- Flood or climate vulnerability indicators
### Data Transformation for Machine Learning
After generating raw and derived features, the following transformations will be applied:
- Encoding categorical variables using label or one-hot encoding
- ## Mobile Application Interface
The MaternalU5Triage system includes a mobile application used by frontline health workers to collect maternal and child health data and receive AI-assisted triage guidance.
